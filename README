Woven is an iOS app that allows users to create collaborative video montages.
Just sign up, add your friends, and start weaving!

Each weave consists of a video that you take and the friends you choose to be the next collaborators on the storyline. You can choose up to 5 friends to add onto the weave. Decide on their order and the users will receive the weave when it's their turn to add on. They'll take a new video, stitch it on, and then send it off automatically to the next person. When it's all done, you can share the finished weave to Facebook or save it to your phone.
